# Sriram_Skill_Assessment

I have analysed all recipes and reviewed ingredient inventory then manually tried different recipe combinations to find the one that fed the maximum number of people without exceeding ingredient limits

such as:

2 × Pizza + 1 × Sandwich + 1 × Pasta → Feeds 11
2 × Pizza + 2 × Sandwich + 1 × Pasta → Feeds 12 (Maximum no.of people fed)
I ensured that the total usage of each ingredient was within the available stock using a table comparison method. Then analysed if the remaining ingredients could make any additional dish. It turned out that no further recipes were possible due to missing dough and cheese
